    r"""A general Metropolis-Hastings proposal

    Concrete implementations can be made by providing a ``proposal_function``
    argument that implements the proposal as described below.
    For standard Gaussian Metropolis moves, :class:`moves.GaussianMove` can be
    used.

    Args:
        proposal_function: The proposal function. It should take 2 arguments: a
            numpy-compatible random number generator and a ``(K, ndim)`` list
            of coordinate vectors. This function should return the proposed
            position and the log-ratio of the proposal probabilities
            (:math:`\ln q(x;\,x^\prime) - \ln q(x^\prime;\,x)` where
            :math:`x^\prime` is the proposed coordinate).
        ndim (Optional[int]): If this proposal is only valid for a specific
            dimension of parameter space, set that here.
