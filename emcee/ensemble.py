    """
    A generalized Ensemble sampler that uses 2 ensembles for parallelization.
    The ``__init__`` function will raise an ``AssertionError`` if
    ``k < 2 * dim`` (and you haven't set the ``live_dangerously`` parameter)
    or if ``k`` is odd.

    **Warning**: The :attr:`chain` member of this object has the shape:
    ``(nwalkers, nlinks, dim)`` where ``nlinks`` is the number of steps
    taken by the chain and ``k`` is the number of walkers.  Use the
    :attr:`flatchain` property to get the chain flattened to
    ``(nlinks, dim)``. For users of pre-1.0 versions, this shape is
    different so be careful!

    :param nwalkers:
        The number of Goodman & Weare "walkers".

    :param dim:
        Number of dimensions in the parameter space.

    :param lnpostfn:
        A function that takes a vector in the parameter space as input and
        returns the natural logarithm of the posterior probability for that
        position.

    :param a: (optional)
        The proposal scale parameter. (default: ``2.0``)

    :param args: (optional)
        A list of extra positional arguments for ``lnpostfn``. ``lnpostfn``
        will be called with the sequence ``lnpostfn(p, *args, **kwargs)``.

    :param kwargs: (optional)
        A list of extra keyword arguments for ``lnpostfn``. ``lnpostfn``
        will be called with the sequence ``lnpostfn(p, *args, **kwargs)``.

    :param postargs: (optional)
        Alias of ``args`` for backwards compatibility.

    :param threads: (optional)
        The number of threads to use for parallelization. If ``threads == 1``,
        then the ``multiprocessing`` module is not used but if
        ``threads > 1``, then a ``Pool`` object is created and calls to
        ``lnpostfn`` are run in parallel.

    :param pool: (optional)
        An alternative method of using the parallelized algorithm. If
        provided, the value of ``threads`` is ignored and the
        object provided by ``pool`` is used for all parallelization. It
        can be any object with a ``map`` method that follows the same
        calling sequence as the built-in ``map`` function.

    :param runtime_sortingfn: (optional)
        A function implementing custom runtime load-balancing. See
        :ref:`loadbalance` for more information.
