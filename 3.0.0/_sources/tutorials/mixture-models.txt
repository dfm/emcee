Tutorial: Practical mixture models
==================================

This is `a post from my
blog <http://dan.iel.fm/posts/mixture-models/>`__ that I've updated to
work with emcee version 3.

There are a lot of reasons why you might use a mixture model and there
is a
`huge <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439840954?tag=danielfm-20>`__
`related <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387310738?tag=danielfm-20>`__
`literature <http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686>`__. That being said, there
are a few questions that I regularly get so I thought that I would write
up the answers.

In astronomy, the most common reason for using a mixture model is to fit
data with outliers so that's the language I'll use but the results are
applicable to any other mixture model. The questions that I'll try to
answer are:

1. How do you derive the *marginalized* likelihood—as popularized by
   `Hogg et al. (2010) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686>`__, I think—and
   why would you want to?
2. How do you work out the mixture membership probabilities (or what is
   the probability that the point is an outlier) after using this model?

The basic model
---------------

The idea here is that you have some data drawn from the model that you
care about and some data points that are outliers—drawn from a different
model that you don't care about! For simplicity, let's consider a linear
model. Everything that I derive here will be applicable to other more
complicated models but it is easier to visualize the linear case. `Hogg
et al. (2010) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686>`__ give a nice treatment
of this linear model with slightly different notation but they miss a
few useful points in the discussion.

To start, let's generate some fake data:

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
    
    # We'll choose the parameters of our synthetic data.
    # The outlier probability will be 80%:
    true_frac = 0.8
    
    # The linear model has unit slope and zero intercept:
    true_params = [1.0, 0.0]
    
    # The outliers are drawn from a Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance:
    true_outliers = [0.0, 1.0]
    
    # For reproducibility, let's set the random number seed and generate the data:
    np.random.seed(12)
    x = np.sort(np.random.uniform(-2, 2, 15))
    yerr = 0.2 * np.ones_like(x)
    y = true_params[0] * x + true_params[1] + yerr * np.random.randn(len(x))
    
    # Those points are all drawn from the correct model so let's replace some of
    # them with outliers.
    m_bkg = np.random.rand(len(x)) > true_frac
    y[m_bkg] = true_outliers[0]
    y[m_bkg] += np.sqrt(true_outliers[1]+yerr[m_bkg]**2) * np.random.randn(sum(m_bkg))
Here's what these data look like. In this plot, the empty, square points
are the true outliers. The purple line is the fit if we don't account
for the fact that there are outliers and just treat all the points
equally. Compare this to the correct answer (shown as the black line).

.. code:: python

    # First, fit the data and find the maximum likelihood model ignoring outliers.
    A = np.vander(x, 2)
    p = np.linalg.solve(np.dot(A.T, A / yerr[:, None]**2), np.dot(A.T, y / yerr**2))
    
    # Then save the *true* line.
    x0 = np.linspace(-2.1, 2.1, 200)
    y0 = np.dot(np.vander(x0, 2), true_params)
    
    # Plot the data and the truth.
    pl.errorbar(x, y, yerr=yerr, fmt=",k", ms=0, capsize=0, lw=1, zorder=999)
    pl.scatter(x[m_bkg], y[m_bkg], marker="s", s=22, c="w", zorder=1000)
    pl.scatter(x[~m_bkg], y[~m_bkg], marker="o", s=22, c="k", zorder=1000)
    pl.plot(x0, y0, color="k", lw=1.5)
    
    # Plot the best fit line.
    pl.plot(x0, x0 * p[0] + p[1], color="#8d44ad", lw=3, alpha=0.5)
    
    pl.xlabel("$x$")
    pl.ylabel("$y$")
    pl.ylim(-2.5, 2.5)
    pl.xlim(-2.1, 2.1);

The purple line is *clearly* a terrible fit because we ignored the
outliers. To fix this, let's generalize this model and add a binary flag
:math:`q_k` for each data point :math:`k`. If :math:`q_k` is zero, then
the point is "good" and the likelihood is given by the usual Gaussian:

.. math:: p(y_k\,|\,x_k,\,\sigma_k,\,\theta,\,q_k=0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\,\pi\,\sigma_k^2}} \exp \left(-\frac{[y_k - f_\theta (x_k)]^2}{2\,\sigma_k^2}\right)

where :math:`f_\theta (x_k) = \theta_1 \, x_k + \theta_2` is the linear
model.

Now, if :math:`q_k = 1` then the point is an outlier and the likelihood
becomes:

.. math:: p(y_k\,|\,x_k,\,\sigma_k,\,\theta,\,q_k=1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\,\pi\,[\sigma_k^2 + \theta_4]}} \exp \left(-\frac{[y_k - \theta_3]^2}{2\,[\sigma_k^2 + \theta_4]}\right) \quad.

I have made the simplifying assumption that the outliers are drawn from
a single Gaussian with mean :math:`\theta_3` and variance
:math:`\theta_4`. From experience, the results aren't normally very
sensitive to the choice of outlier model and the Gaussian model is often
good enough but the following derivations will be valid for any model
that you choose.

Under this new model, the full likelihood for the entire dataset
becomes:

.. math:: p(\{y_k\}\,|\,\{x_k\},\,\{\sigma_k\},\,\theta,\,\{q_k\}) = \prod_{k=1}^{K} p(y_k\,|\,x_k,\sigma_k,\,\theta,\,q_k)

where, for each term, the correct Gaussian is chosen depending on the
value of :math:`q_k`. To write this equation, I've assumed that the data
points are independent and if that's not true for your dataset then
things get *a lot* harder.

Now we could just take this likelihood function, apply priors, and use
MCMC to find posterior constraints on :math:`\theta` and the
:math:`\{q_k\}` flags but this would be hard for a few reasons. First,
if you're used to using `emcee <http://dfm.io/emcee>`__ for your MCMC
needs, you'll find that it's pretty hard to implement a model with
discrete variables so you'd probably need to learn some
`other <http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/>`__
`sampler <http://mc-stan.org/>`__ and, honestly, it probably wouldn't
work well for this problem either! Which brings us to our second
problem. This problem is *very* high dimensional and the dimension
scales with the number of data points. Without the outlier model, the
problem is only two-dimensional but when we include the outliers, the
model suddenly becomes :math:`(4 + K)`-dimensional, where :math:`K` is
the number of data points. This will always be hard! Therefore, in
practice, it is useful to marginalize out the badly behaved parameters
(:math:`q_k`) and just sample in :math:`\theta`.

The marginalized likelihood
---------------------------

In order to marginalize out the :math:`\{q_k\}` flags, we need to choose
a prior :math:`p(q_k)`. After making this choice (I won't specialize
yet), the marginalization can be written:

.. math:: p(\{y_k\}\,|\,\{x_k\},\,\{\sigma_k\},\,\theta) = \sum_{\{q_k\}} \prod_{k=1}^{K} p(q_k) \, p(y_k\,|\,x_k,\,\sigma_k,\,\theta,\,q_k)

where the sum is over all the possible permutations of the :math:`q_k`
flags. If you squint for a second, you'll see that you can actually
switch the order of the sum and product without changing anything. This
follows from our assumption that the data points are independent.
Therefore, we're left with the much simpler likelihood function

.. math:: p(\{y_k\}\,|\,\{x_k\},\,\{\sigma_k\},\,\theta) = \prod_{k=1}^{K} p(y_k\,|\,x_k,\,\sigma_k,\,\theta)

where

.. math:: p(y_k\,|\,x_k,\,\sigma_k,\,\theta) = \sum_{q_k} p(q_k) \, p(y_k\,|\,x_k,\,\sigma_k,\,\theta,\,q_k) \quad.

The prior :math:`p(q_k)` could be different for every data point but it
is often sufficient to choose a simple model like

.. math::

   p(q_k) = \left \{\begin{array}{ll}
   Q & \mathrm{if}\,q_k=0 \\
   1-Q & \mathrm{if}\,q_k=1
   \end{array}\right.

where :math:`Q \in [0, 1]` is a constant that sets the prior probability
that a point is drawn from the foreground model. Chosing this model, we
recover the (possibly) familiar likelihood function from `Hogg et al.
(2010) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686>`__:

.. math:: p(\{y_k\}\,|\,\{x_k\},\,\{\sigma_k\},\,\theta) = \prod_{k=1}^{K} \left [ Q\,p(y_k\,|\,x_k,\,\sigma_k,\,\theta,\,q_k=0) + (1-Q)\,p(y_k\,|\,x_k,\,\sigma_k,\,\theta,\,q_k=1) \right ] \quad.

This is a much easier model to sample so let's do that now:

.. code:: python

    import emcee
    
    class LinearMixtureModel(emcee.BaseWalker):
        
        bounds = [(0.1, 1.9), (-0.9, 0.9), (0, 1), (-2.4, 2.4), (-7.2, 5.2)]
    
        def lnpriorfn(self, p):
            """We'll just put reasonable uniform priors on all the parameters."""
            if not all(b[0] < v < b[1] for v, b in zip(p, self.bounds)):
                return -np.inf
            return 0
    
        def lnlike_fg(self, p):
            """The "foreground" linear likelihood."""
            m, b, _, M, lnV = p
            model = m * x + b
            return -0.5 * (((model - y) / yerr) ** 2 + 2 * np.log(yerr))
    
        def lnlike_bg(self, p):
            """The "background" outlier likelihood."""
            _, _, Q, M, lnV = p
            var = np.exp(lnV) + yerr**2
            return -0.5 * ((M - y) ** 2 / var + np.log(var))
    
        def lnlikefn(self, p):
            """The full marginalized likelihood function."""
            m, b, Q, M, lnV = p
    
            # Compute the vector of foreground likelihoods and include the q prior.
            ll_fg = self.lnlike_fg(p)
            self.arg1 = ll_fg + np.log(Q)
    
            # Compute the vector of background likelihoods and include the q prior.
            ll_bg = self.lnlike_bg(p)
            self.arg2 = ll_bg + np.log(1.0 - Q)
    
            # Combine these using log-add-exp for numerical stability.
            return np.sum(np.logaddexp(self.arg1, self.arg2))
    
    # Initialize the walkers at a reasonable location.
    nwalkers = 32
    p0 = np.array([1.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.0, np.log(2.0)])
    ndim = len(p0)
    coords = p0 + 1e-5 * np.random.randn(nwalkers, ndim)
    ensemble = emcee.Ensemble(LinearMixtureModel(), coords)
    
    # Set up the sampler.
    sampler = emcee.Sampler()
    
    # Run a burn-in chain and save only the final location.
    ensemble = sampler.run(ensemble, 500, store=False)
    
    # We're going to need to save the two likelihood componenents
    # in an array called weights.
    nsteps = 1500
    weights = np.empty((nsteps, nwalkers, 2, len(x)), dtype=float)
    
    # Now we'll sample the production chain and store the weights at each step.
    for i, ensemble in enumerate(sampler.sample(ensemble, nsteps)):
        for j, w in enumerate(ensemble.walkers):
            weights[i, j] = w.arg1, w.arg2
This code should only take about a minute to run. Compare that to any
attempt you've ever made at sampling the same problem with another 15 or
more parameters and you should be pretty stoked!

Let's show the resulting parameter constraints and compare them to the
*true* values (indicated in blue) used to generate the synthetic
dataset. This should encourage us that we've done something reasonable.

.. code:: python

    import triangle
    labels = ["$m$", "$b$", "$Q$", "$M$", "$\ln V$"]
    truths = true_params + [true_frac, true_outliers[0], np.log(true_outliers[1])]
    flatchain = sampler.get_coords(flat=True)
    triangle.corner(flatchain, bins=35, extents=LinearMixtureModel.bounds, labels=labels, truths=truths);


.. image:: mixture-models_files/mixture-models_11_0.png


Similarly, the predicted constraint on the linear model is:

.. code:: python

    # Compute the quantiles of the predicted line and plot them.
    A = np.vander(x0, 2)
    lines = np.dot(flatchain[:, :2], A.T)
    quantiles = np.percentile(lines, [16, 84], axis=0)
    pl.fill_between(x0, quantiles[0], quantiles[1], color="#8d44ad", alpha=0.5)
    
    # Plot the data.
    pl.errorbar(x, y, yerr=yerr, fmt=",k", ms=0, capsize=0, lw=1, zorder=999)
    pl.scatter(x, y, marker="o", s=22, c="k", zorder=1000)
    
    # Plot the true line.
    pl.plot(x0, y0, color="k", lw=1.5)
    
    pl.xlabel("$x$")
    pl.ylabel("$y$")
    pl.ylim(-2.5, 2.5)
    pl.xlim(-2.1, 2.1);

Great! Comparing the purple swath to the true line (shown in black), I
think that we can all agree that this is a much better fit! But now, how
do we label the points to decide which ones are outliers?

Mixture membership probabilities
--------------------------------

Okay. So now we have a model that we can sample and it seems to give us
reasonable results but didn't we throw away a lot of information when we
used the marginalized likelihood instead of sampling in the :math:`q_k`
parameters? If we sampled the full model, we would, after all, get
marginalized posterior constraints on the *outlierness* of each point.
This is a very common question when I suggest that people use this model
so I wanted to show that you're actually not throwing anything away and
with a tiny bit of extra computation, you can recover these constraints!

To be specific, the thing that we want to compute is:

.. math:: p(q_k\,|\,y) = \int p(q_k,\,\theta\,|\,y)\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \int p(q_k\,|\,y,\,\theta)\,p(\theta\,|\,y)\,\mathrm{d}\theta \quad,

the posterior probability of a specific point :math:`k` being good
(:math:`q_k=0`) given all the data. In this equation, I've simplified
the notation a bit and :math:`y = \{y_k\}` now indicates *all the data*
and I'm leaving out the implied :math:`\{x_k\},\,\{\sigma_k\}` on the
right-hand side of every probability. To compute this, we'll need to
evaluate the conditional probability

.. math:: p(q_k\,|\,y,\,\theta) = \frac{p(q_k)\,p(y\,|\,\theta,\,q_k)}{\sum_{j} p(q_k=j)\,p(y\,|\,\theta,\,q_k=j)}

where the sum is over every allowed value of :math:`q_k`. Both the
numerator and denominator are used when computing the marginalized
likelihood so if we hang onto those, we can re-use them to compute the
membership probabilities. In the example above, I stored these results
in the ``weights`` array so it'll be ease to evaluate
:math:`p(q_k\,|\,y,\,\theta^{(n)})` for each sample :math:`\theta^{(n)}`
from the chain.

Then, we need to realize that the Markov chain gave us samples
:math:`\theta^{(n)}` from the probability distribution
:math:`p(\theta\,|\,y)`, so we can approximate the previous integral as

.. math:: p(q_k\,|\,y) = \int p(q_k\,|\,y,\,\theta)\,p(\theta\,|\,y)\,\mathrm{d}\theta \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N p(q_k\,|\,y,\,\theta^{(n)}) \quad.

Therefore, the posterior probaility of being an outlier or not can be
computed by just taking the average of a bunch of values that we've
already computed! In practice, this would look like the following:

.. code:: python

    norm = np.logaddexp.reduce(weights, axis=2)
    fg_prob = np.mean(np.exp(weights[:, :, 0] - norm), axis=(0, 1))
Therefore, from left to right, the marginalized posterior probability
that each point is part of the foreground model is:

.. code:: python

    print(", ".join(map("{0:.3f}".format, fg_prob)))

.. parsed-literal::

    0.379, 0.938, 0.000, 0.956, 0.000, 0.897, 0.891, 0.834, 0.865, 0.970, 0.000, 0.995, 0.995, 0.996, 0.978


This model works pretty well... so well, in fact, that the strong
outliers are given nearly zero probability of being in the foreground
model!

Finally, it can be useful to label outliers on the final plot so let's
use a color scale on the points to show this probability. In the figure
below, darker points are more likely to be drawn from the line. This
plot is pretty satisfying because the model has done a good job labeling
all but one outlier at high confidence!

.. code:: python

    # Plot the predition.
    pl.fill_between(x0, quantiles[0], quantiles[1], color="#8d44ad", alpha=0.5)
    
    # Plot the data points.
    pl.errorbar(x, y, yerr=yerr, fmt=",k", ms=0, capsize=0, lw=1, zorder=999)
    # Plot the (true) outliers.
    pl.scatter(x[m_bkg], y[m_bkg], marker="s", s=22, c=fg_prob[m_bkg], cmap="gray_r", vmin=0, vmax=1, zorder=1000)
    # Plot the (true) good points.
    pl.scatter(x[~m_bkg], y[~m_bkg], marker="o", s=22, c=fg_prob[~m_bkg], cmap="gray_r", vmin=0, vmax=1, zorder=1000)
    
    # Plot the true line.
    pl.plot(x0, y0, color="k", lw=1.5)
    
    pl.xlabel("$x$")
    pl.ylabel("$y$")
    pl.ylim(-2.5, 2.5)
    pl.xlim(-2.1, 2.1);
