Tutorial: Fitting a Model to Data
=================================

If you’re reading this right now then you’re probably interested in
using emcee to fit a model to some noisy data. On this page, I’ll
demonstrate how you might do this in the simplest non-trivial model that
I could think of: fitting a line to data when you don’t believe the
error bars on your data. The interested reader should check out `Hogg,
Bovy & Lang (2010) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686>`__ for a much more
complete discussion of how to fit a line to data in The Real World™ and
why MCMC might come in handy.

This tutorial was automatically generated using an IPython notebook that
can be downloaded `here </_static/notebooks/line.ipynb>`__.

Generating fake data from the model
-----------------------------------

When you approach a new problem, the first step is generally to write
down the likelihood function (the probability of a dataset given the
model parameters). This is equivalent to describing the generative
procedure for the data. In this case, we’re going to consider a linear
model where the quoted uncertainties are underestimated by a constant
fractional amount. You can generate a synthetic dataset from this model:

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    np.random.seed(123)
    
    # Choose the "true" parameters.
    m_true = -0.9594
    b_true = 4.294
    f_true = 0.534
    
    # Generate some synthetic data from the model.
    N = 50
    x = np.sort(10*np.random.rand(N))
    yerr = 0.1+0.5*np.random.rand(N)
    y = m_true*x+b_true
    y += np.abs(f_true*y) * np.random.randn(N)
    y += yerr * np.random.randn(N)
This synthetic dataset (with the underestimated error bars) will look
something like:

.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
    
    x0 = np.linspace(0, 10, 2)
    def plot_data():
        pl.errorbar(x, y, yerr=yerr, fmt=".k", capsize=0)
        pl.plot(x0, m_true * x0 + b_true, "k", lw=2, alpha=0.9)
        pl.ylim(-8.5, 8.5)
        pl.xlabel("$x$")
        pl.ylabel("$y$");
        
    plot_data()


.. image:: line_files/line_3_0.png


The true model is shown as the thick black line and the effect of the
underestimated uncertainties is obvious when you look at this figure.

Maximum-likelihood solution
---------------------------

The standard method for fitting a line to these data is linear least
squares. This is equivalent to assuming that the uncertainties on each
:math:`y` measurement are Gaussian, independent, and known. Linear least
squares is appealing because solving for the parameters—and their
associated uncertainties—is simply a linear algebraic operation. The
least squares (or maximum likelihood) solution for these data can be
computed in Python as follows:

.. code:: python

    A = np.vstack((np.ones_like(x), x)).T
    ivar = 1.0 / yerr**2
    cov = np.linalg.inv(np.dot(A.T, ivar[:, None] * A))
    b_ls, m_ls = np.dot(cov, np.dot(A.T, ivar * y))
This result gives the following constraints on the slope and intercept
parameters:

.. code:: python

    from IPython.display import display, Math
    display(Math(r"m_\mathrm{{LS}} = {0:.2f} \pm {1:.2f}".format(m_ls, np.sqrt(cov[1, 1]))))
    display(Math(r"b_\mathrm{{LS}} = {0:.2f} \pm {1:.2f}".format(b_ls, np.sqrt(cov[0, 0]))))


.. math::

    m_\mathrm{LS} = -1.10 \pm 0.02



.. math::

    b_\mathrm{LS} = 5.44 \pm 0.09


And we can plot the maximum likelihood line on top of the data points
and compare it to the true line that was used to generate the data:

.. code:: python

    plot_data()
    pl.plot(x0, m_ls * x0 + b_ls, "--k", lw=1.5);


.. image:: line_files/line_9_0.png


This isn’t an unreasonable result but the uncertainties on the slope and
intercept seem a little small (because of the small error bars on most
of the data points).

Building the probabilistic model
--------------------------------

If we relax our above assumption that we know all the uncertainties
correctly and model them instead, we will find the following likelihood
function:

.. math::

   \ln\,p(y\,|\,x,\sigma,m,b,f) =
   -\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \left[
     \frac{(y_n-m\,x_n-b)^2}{s_n^2}
     + \ln \left ( 2\pi\,s_n^2 \right )
   \right]

where

.. math:: s_n^2 = \sigma_n^2+f^2\,(m\,x_n+b)^2 \quad .

Unfortunately, under this model, the isn't an analytic maximum
likelihood solution like least squares. This time, we would need to
optimize (maximize) this function numerically using something like the
`scipy.optimize <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html>`__
module but that's a discussion for another time.

Let's ask a different question instead: how do we estimate the
uncertainties on :math:`m` and :math:`b`? What's more, we probably don't
really care too much about the value of :math:`f` but we do want to
propagate any uncertainties about its value to our final estimates of
:math:`m` and :math:`b`. This is where MCMC comes in.

This isn't the place to get into the details of why you might want to
use MCMC in your research but it is worth commenting that a common
reason is that you would like to marginalize over some "nuisance
parameters" and find an estimate of the posterior probability function
(the distribution of parameters that is consistent with your dataset)
for others. MCMC lets you do both of these things in one fell swoop! You
need to start by writing down the posterior probability function (up to
a constant):

.. math:: p (m,b,f\,|\,x,y,\sigma) \propto p(m,b,f)\,p(y\,|\,x,\sigma,m,b,f) \quad .

We have already, written down the (log-)likelihood function

.. math:: p(y\,|\,x,\sigma,m,b,f)

so the missing component is the "prior" function

.. math:: p(m,b,f) \quad .

This function encodes any previous knowledge that we have about the
parameters: results from other experiments, physically acceptable
ranges, etc. It is necessary that you write down priors if you're going
to use MCMC because all that MCMC does is draw samples from a
probability distribution and you want that to be a probability
distribution for your parameters. This is important: **you cannot draw
parameter samples from your likelihood function**. This is because a
likelihood function is a probability distribution **over datasets** so,
conditioned on model parameters, you can draw representative datasets
(as demonstrated at the beginning of this exercise) but you cannot draw
parameter samples.

In this example, we'll use uniform (so-called "uninformative") priors on
:math:`m`, :math:`b` and the logarithm of :math:`f`. For example, we'll
use the following conservative prior on :math:`m`:

.. math::

   p(m) = \left \{\begin{array}{ll}
   1 / 5.5 \,, & \mbox{if}\,-5 < m < 1/2 \\
   0 \,, & \mbox{otherwise}
   \end{array}
   \right .

To implement this in emcee, you would code these functions up in a
subclass of the `emcee.BaseWalker </api/#emcee.BaseWalker>`__ object as
implemented below. Take a minute to study this code and compare it to
the equations from this section. If you're not familiar with
object-oriented programming in Python, don't worry because it doesn't
really get more complicated than this.

.. code:: python

    import emcee
    
    class LinearModel(emcee.BaseWalker):
        
        def __init__(self, x, y, yerr):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
            self.yerr2 = yerr ** 2
        
        def lnpriorfn(self, theta):
            m, b, lnf = theta
            if -5.0 < m < 0.5 and 0.0 < b < 10.0 and -10.0 < lnf < 1.0:
                return 0.0
            return -np.inf
    
        def lnlikefn(self, theta):
            m, b, lnf = theta
            model = m * self.x + b
            inv_sigma2 = 1.0/(self.yerr2 + model**2*np.exp(2*lnf))
            return -0.5*(np.sum((self.y-model)**2*inv_sigma2 - np.log(inv_sigma2)))
A few comments/questions about this code:

1. It's important that the two methods are called ``lnpriorfn`` and
   ``lnlikefn`` (and you need to implement both of them).
2. What is the ``self`` argument? What about ``theta``?
3. Why am I returning ``0.0`` from ``lnpriorfn`` instead of something
   like ``-log(5.5)``?

Sampling from the posterior probability
---------------------------------------

After all this setup, it's easy to sample this probability distribution
using emcee. I'm not going to go into detail about how the algorithm
works (you should `read the paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3665>`__)
but the basic idea is that it takes an "ensemble" of "walkers" and
updates the walkers' coordinates in parameter space. You repeat this
update many times (storing all the updated coordintes) and this gives a
list of samples :math:`\theta` from the probability distribution
:math:`p (m,b,f\,|\,x,y,\sigma)`.

To start, you need to choose the coordinates of the walkers in the
initial ensemble. This can be hard and the quality of your results can
(in practice) depend on this choice. In this example, we'll use 100
walkers and initialize them in a small Gaussian ball around a reasonable
first guess (that I chose by looking at the data):

.. code:: python

    ndim, nwalkers = 3, 100
    coords = np.array([-1.0, 4.0, -0.5]) + 1e-4*np.random.randn(nwalkers, ndim)
    ensemble = emcee.Ensemble(LinearModel(x, y, yerr), coords)
Note that the order of the parameters in the coordinate vectors should
be the same as the order that you use in your implementation of
``LinearModel`` from above.

When we executed the above code snippet, each walker already computed
the value of the probabilistic model at its coordinates in parameter
space. Therefore, we can look at the values for the first walker:

.. code:: python

    print("The first walker has the coordinates: {0}".format(ensemble.coords[0]))
    print("and ln-prior={0:.3f}, ln-likelihood={1:.3f}, and lnprobability={2:.3f}"
          .format(ensemble.lnprior[0], ensemble.lnlike[0], ensemble.lnprob[0]))

.. parsed-literal::

    The first walker has the coordinates: [-1.00016154  3.99997684 -0.49992283]
    and ln-prior=0.000, ln-likelihood=-48.060, and lnprobability=-48.060


Now, let's run 500 steps of MCMC (starting from this ensemble) and see
what happens:

.. code:: python

    sampler = emcee.Sampler()
    sampler.run(ensemble, 500);
Let's plot the coordinates of the walkers as a function of step number
in the chain (the chain is stored in the ``coords`` property on the
sampler or it can be accessed more flexibly using the ``get_coords()``
function):

.. code:: python

    chain = sampler.get_coords()
    fig, axes = pl.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True, figsize=(6, 6))
    for k, nm in enumerate(["$m$", "$b$", r"$\ln f$"]):
        axes[k].plot(chain[:, :, k], "k", alpha=0.3)
        axes[k].locator_params(tight=True, nbins=6)
        axes[k].yaxis.set_label_coords(-0.15, 0.5)
        axes[k].set_ylabel(nm)


.. image:: line_files/line_19_0.png


It looks like the chain converged after the first 100 steps so we'll
discard those samples and plot the resulting parameter constraints using
the `triangle.py <https://github.com/dfm/triangle.py>`__ package (you
might need to install it). Note the use of the ``flat=True`` argument in
the ``get_coords()`` method.

.. code:: python

    import triangle
    flatchain = sampler.get_coords(discard=100, flat=True)
    triangle.corner(flatchain, labels=["$m$", "$b$", "$\ln\,f$"],
                    truths=[m_true, b_true, np.log(f_true)]);

This plot shows all the one and two dimensional projections of the
posterior probability distributions of your parameters. This is useful
because it quickly demonstrates all of the covariances between
parameters. Also, the way that you find the marginalized distribution
for a parameter or set of parameters using the results of the MCMC chain
is to project the samples into that plane and then make an N-dimensional
histogram. That means that the corner plot shows the marginalized
distribution for each parameter independently in the histograms along
the diagonal and then the marginalized two dimensional distributions in
the other panels.

Another good thing to plot is the projection of your results into the
space of the observed data. To do this, you can choose a few (say 50 in
this case) samples from the chain and plot them on top of the data
points:

.. code:: python

    for i in np.random.randint(len(flatchain), size=50):
        m, b, _ = flatchain[i]
        pl.plot(x0, m * x0 + b, "g", alpha=0.1)
    plot_data()


.. image:: line_files/line_23_0.png


This leaves us with one question: which numbers should go in the
abstract? There are a few different options for this but my favorite is
to quote the uncertainties based on the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles
of the samples in the marginalized distributions. To compute these
numbers for this example, you would run:

.. code:: python

    q = np.percentile(flatchain, [16, 50, 84], axis=0)
    mean = q[1]
    uncert = np.diff(q, axis=0).T
    
    for i, (nm, truth) in enumerate(zip(("m", "b", "\ln f"),
                                        (m_true, b_true, np.log(f_true)))):
        display(Math(r"{0}_\mathrm{{MCMC}} = {1:.3f} _{{-{2:.3f}}}^{{+{3:.3f}}} \quad (\mathrm{{truth:}}\,{4:.3f})"
                     .format(nm, mean[i], uncert[i][0], uncert[i][1], truth)))


.. math::

    m_\mathrm{MCMC} = -1.004 _{-0.079}^{+0.079} \quad (\mathrm{truth:}\,-0.959)



.. math::

    b_\mathrm{MCMC} = 4.527 _{-0.357}^{+0.357} \quad (\mathrm{truth:}\,4.294)



.. math::

    \ln f_\mathrm{MCMC} = -0.761 _{-0.148}^{+0.159} \quad (\mathrm{truth:}\,-0.627)


Which isn't half bad when compared to the true values!

emcee comes with many more advanced features that you can find described
in these documentation pages but this should be enough to get you
started. Just update the ``LinearModel`` class to implement
``YourSickModel`` and see how it goes!
