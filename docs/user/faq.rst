**The not-so-frequently asked questions that still have useful answers**

.. _walkers:

What are "walkers"?
-------------------

Walkers are the members of the ensemble. They are almost like separate
Metropolis-Hastings chains but, of course, the proposal distribution for
a given walker depends on the positions of all the other walkers in the
ensemble. See `Goodman & Weare (2010)
<http://msp.berkeley.edu/camcos/2010/5-1/p04.xhtml>`_ for more details.


How should I initialize the walkers?
------------------------------------

The best technique seems to be to start in a small ball around the a priori
preferred position. Don't worry, the walkers quickly branch out and explore
the rest of the space.

Wrapping C++ code
-----------------

There are numerous ways to do it, see
`the python wiki
<https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages#C.2FC.2B-.2B->`_.

Extra care has to be taken if mpi support is needed as the mpi4py module used by
emcee depends on the pickle module to send a function call to different
processors/cores.

A minimal extension of the mpi.py example in which the target density is coded
in C++ and wrapped with the `swig library <http://swig.org/>`_ is shown in this
`gist <https://gist.github.com/fredRos/7122649>`_. It also demonstrates the hacks
needed to get the pickling to work.


Parameter limits
----------------

In order to confine the walkers to a finite volume of the parameter space, have
your function return negative infinity outside of the volume corresponding to
the logarithm of 0 prior probability using::

 return -numpy.inf

Note: if your function is written in C++, use::

 return -std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();

and avoid::

 return -std::numeric_limits<double>::max();

as it does not have the desired effect.

Troubleshooting
---------------

**I'm getting weird spikes in my data/I have low acceptance fractions/both...
what should I do?**

Double the number of walkers. If that doesn't work, double it again. And
again. Until you run out of RAM. At that point, I don't know!


**The walkers are getting stuck in "islands" of low likelihood. How can I
fix that?**

Try increasing the number of walkers. If that doesn't work, you can try
pruning using a clustering algorithm like the one found in
`arxiv:1104.2612 <http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2612>`_.
